# Complete FHEVM Tutorial

## Introduction

This tutorial walks you through building a confidential token contract using Zama's FHEVM library.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Solidity knowledge
- Understanding of ERC20 tokens
- Familiarity with Web3 concepts

## The Problem

Traditional blockchain tokens expose all balances and transactions publicly. This is a privacy concern for:

- Financial applications
- Corporate tokenization
- Identity systems
- Private DeFi

## The Solution: FHEVM

Fully Homomorphic Encryption allows computation on encrypted data without decryption.

### Key Concepts

**euint64**: Encrypted unsigned integer (64 bit)  
**FHE.add()**: Addition on encrypted values  
**FHE.sub()**: Subtraction on encrypted values  
**FHE.select()**: Conditional selection based on encrypted boolean
